/// An AbstractSpreadsheet object represents the state of a simple spreadsheet.  A
/// spreadsheet consists of an infinite number of named cells.
///
/// A string is a cell name if and only if it consists of a letter or underscore followed by
/// zero or more letters, underscores, or digits, AND it satisfies the predicate IsValid.
/// For example, "_", "A1", and "BC89" are cell names so long as they satisfy IsValid.
/// On the other hand, "0A1", "1+1", and "" are not cell names, regardless of IsValid.
///
/// Any valid incoming cell name, whether passed as a parameter or embedded in a formula,
/// must be normalized with the Normalize method before it is used by or saved in
/// this spreadsheet.  For example, if Normalize is s => s.ToUpper(), then
/// the Formula "x3+a5" should be converted to "X3+A5" before use.
///
/// A spreadsheet contains a cell corresponding to every possible cell name.
/// In addition to a name, each cell has a contents and a value.  The distinction is
/// important.
///
/// The contents of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a Formula.  If the
/// contents is an empty string, we say that the cell is empty.  (By analogy, the contents
/// of a cell in Excel is what is displayed on the editing line when the cell is selected.)
///
/// In a new spreadsheet, the contents of every cell is the empty string.
///
/// The value of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a FormulaError.
/// (By analogy, the value of an Excel cell is what is displayed in that cell's position
/// in the grid.)
///
/// If a cell's contents is a string, its value is that string.
///
/// If a cell's contents is a double, its value is that double.
///
/// If a cell's contents is a Formula, its value is either a double or a FormulaError,
/// as reported by the Evaluate method of the Formula class.  The value of a Formula,
/// of course, can depend on the values of variables.  The value of a variable is the
/// value of the spreadsheet cell it names (if that cell's value is a double) or
/// is undefined (otherwise).
///
/// Spreadsheets are never allowed to contain a combination of Formulas that establish
/// a circular dependency.  A circular dependency exists when a cell depends on itself.
/// For example, suppose that A1 contains B1*2, B1 contains C1*2, and C1 contains A1*2.
/// A1 depends on B1, which depends on C1, which depends on A1.  That's a circular
/// dependency.
