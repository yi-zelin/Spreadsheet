/// An AbstractSpreadsheet object represents the state of a simple spreadsheet.  A 
/// spreadsheet consists of an infinite number of named cells.
/// 
/// A string is a valid cell name if and only if:
///   (1) its first character is an underscore or a letter
///   (2) its remaining characters (if any) are underscores and/or letters and/or digits
/// Note that this is the same as the definition of valid variable from the PS3 Formula class.
/// 
/// For example, "x", "_", "x2", "y_15", and "___" are all valid cell  names, but
/// "25", "2x", and "&" are not.  Cell names are case sensitive, so "x" and "X" are
/// different cell names.
/// 
/// A spreadsheet contains a cell corresponding to every possible cell name.  (This
/// means that a spreadsheet contains an infinite number of cells.)  In addition to 
/// a name, each cell has a contents and a value.  The distinction is important.
/// 
/// The contents of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a Formula.  If the
/// contents is an empty string, we say that the cell is empty.  (By analogy, the contents
/// of a cell in Excel is what is displayed on the editing line when the cell is selected).
/// 
/// In a new spreadsheet, the contents of every cell is the empty string.
///  
/// We are not concerned with values in PS4, but to give context for the future of the project,
/// the value of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a FormulaError.  
/// (By analogy, the value of an Excel cell is what is displayed in that cell's position
/// in the grid). 
/// 
/// If a cell's contents is a string, its value is that string.
/// 
/// If a cell's contents is a double, its value is that double.
/// 
/// If a cell's contents is a Formula, its value is either a double or a FormulaError,
/// as reported by the Evaluate method of the Formula class.  The value of a Formula,
/// of course, can depend on the values of variables.  The value of a variable is the 
/// value of the spreadsheet cell it names (if that cell's value is a double) or 
/// is undefined (otherwise).
/// 
/// Spreadsheets are never allowed to contain a combination of Formulas that establish
/// a circular dependency.  A circular dependency exists when a cell depends on itself.
/// For example, suppose that A1 contains B1*2, B1 contains C1*2, and C1 contains A1*2.
/// A1 depends on B1, which depends on C1, which depends on A1.  That's a circular
/// dependency.
